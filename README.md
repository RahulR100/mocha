# Mocha

Mocha is a prototype meeting app that enables users to set, modify and track progress according to an agenda.

This app is built using NodeJS, Socket.io, and Peerjs(WebRTC) and builds on [itstaranarora/video-chat-v1](https://github.com/itstaranarora/video-chat-v1). It also has custom peer servers, and a custom STUN and TURN server to enable video calls over symmetric NATs.
